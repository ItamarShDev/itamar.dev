## Abstract

React is cool. React is love.
But react also deviates us from the core JS API.
We keep saying that React is only JS, but the truth is React is everything but JS.

# Enjoy Writing Code

When using Remix.run, you will start loving code again.
Every time you will have to go to the docs to learn how to implement something, you will get the same answer: use JS and HTML.

This is awesome.

> Have inputs? use Forms.
> Want to submit the form? use FormData
> Need and Api endpoint? here's a cool hook

That's it. I just came to show my appreciation.

Bye.
